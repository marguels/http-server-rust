# Simple HTTP Server in Rust

This project is a basic HTTP server built in Rust as part of a learning exercise from [Codecrafter](https://codecrafter.net/), an incredible platform for coding challenges and learning. The server is designed to handle basic HTTP requests and serve static files. This project serves as a foundation and will evolve over time with additional features and improvements.

## Codecrafters
This is my solution to the
["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview), written in Rust.

A big thank you to [Codecrafters](https://codecrafters.io) for providing the challenges and learning opportunities that result in this project.

If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) try the challenge.

## How to test it

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (latest stable version recommended). You can install them via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-http-server-rust.git
cd simple-http-server-rust
```
2. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
3. Run the server:
```bash
Copy code
cargo run --release
```
By default, the server will run on localhost:8080. You can access it by navigating to http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.
